# Introduction
G'day, and welcome to Hotham! 👋

Hotham is an attempt to create a lightweight, high performance game engine for standalone VR headsets, like the Oculus Quest 2.

It's primarily aimed at small (1-5 person) teams of mostly technical folk who are looking to create VR games, but find existing tools cumbersome to work with. You can learn more about the project [in the FAQ](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham/wiki/FAQ) or by checking out [our talk at the Rust Gamedev Meetup](https://youtu.be/adt63Gqt6yA?t=717).

# Getting started
Hotham is a complex project with many moving parts! Have no fear - we've written an easy to follow [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham/wiki/Getting-started) that will have you running our example application in no time. Head on over to [getting started](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham/wiki/Getting-started) to.. get.. started.

# Sponsoring
Hotham's development is only possible thanks to the support of the community. It's currently being developed on full time by [@kanerogers](https://github.com/kanerogers) If you'd like to help make VR development in Rust possible, please [consider becoming a donor](https://github.com/sponsors/leetvr). 💗

## Featured sponsors
These generous people contribute $50 or more each month to support Hotham ❤️
