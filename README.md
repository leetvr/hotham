# Introduction
G'day, and welcome to Hotham! 👋

Hotham is an attempt to create a lightweight, high performance game engine for mobile VR headsets. It's primarily aimed at small (1-5 person) teams of mostly technical folk who are looking to create games for devices like the Oculus Quest, but find existing tools cumbersome to work with.

If you're looking for a more general purpose engine to create games in Rust, make sure you check out [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/)! If, however, you're looking for a way to make VR development less painful, Hotham will be available to developers in early October 2021.

For a full list of what's going to be available, checkout [the 0.1 issue](https://github.com/leetvr/hotham/issues/64). Your feedback is very *very* welcome! ❤️
